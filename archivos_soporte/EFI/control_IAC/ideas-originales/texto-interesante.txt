Ahh, I love the Non Harley indoctrinated here. It's entertaining as they get a glimpse of the dark side. That is not a knock, just an observation.
Back in the stone age (OK the 80's) we used to regularly have low idle contests at Harley event's. The lowest I ever saw/heard was a panhead that idled right at 375rpm. He could get it down to 300 but it would cough and stall after about 20 seconds there.
It was not uncommon on pre pollution controlled Harley's to idle in the 600 rpm range, and the bottom ends lasted just fine. Remember that Harley's have roller and ball bearing, not plain bearings, so they do NOT rely on oil pressure, just circulation. 5 lbs at idle is PLENTY. It will scare you the first ime you put an oil pressure gauge on a Harley motor. Some of the early oil pressure warning lights kicked on as low as 3 lbs!
